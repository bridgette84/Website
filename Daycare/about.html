        <h1>About Us!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Home Sweet Home Daycare, where we provide a safe, nurturing, and stimulating environment for your child. We are a licensed home daycare business established in 2023 by Mrs. Anna, a certified early childhood educator with over 10 years of experience. Our mission is to offer high-quality care and education that fosters the physical, social, emotional, and cognitive development of each child.</p>
        <p>At Home Sweet Home, we believe that every child is unique and deserves individual attention and guidance. We follow a play-based curriculum that encourages children to explore, discover, and learn through their own interests and abilities. We also incorporate various activities, such as music, art, storytime, and outdoor play, to enhance their skills and creativity.</p>
        <p>Our home daycare is located in a spacious and comfortable house with a large backyard and a playground. We have separate rooms for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers, each equipped with age-appropriate toys, books, and materials. We also provide healthy meals and snacks that meet the nutritional needs of each child.</p>
        <img src="images/backyard_playarea.jpg" class="round" alt="backyard area for kids">
        <p>We are open from Monday to Friday, from 7:00 am to 6:00 pm. We accept children from 6 months to 5 years old. We have a low child-to-teacher ratio to ensure each child receives adequate care and supervision. We also have a strict health and safety policy to protect our children and staff from any potential risks.</p>
        <p>If you are looking for a reliable, affordable, and quality home daycare for your child, please contact us today to schedule a tour or enroll your child. We look forward to meeting you and your family!</p>
